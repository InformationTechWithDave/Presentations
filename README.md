# Presentations

I'm using this GitHub site to share copies of the presentations that accompany my YouTube channel, @InformationTechWithDave.

https://www.youtube.com/@InformationTechWithDave

Information Technology With Dave is produced by a veteran of IT with more than two decades of experience in building, supporting, and architecting broadband networks, virtual environments, Linux and Windows servers, datacenters, and cybersecurity. For over 20 years I've worked for one of the USA's largest ISPs.

In the past I worked with COMPTIA as a subject matter expert on the Linux+ certification exam.

Join me as I share some of the knowledge that I've picked up over the years.

I hope you find this information useful.
